### Questions
- How do I send out a message to vent my problems or request for advice?
    - Simply message the bot like you were messaging anyone else on Discord! It will reply with a 
    green check if it is properly received!
    
- How do I reply to other people?
    - Use the command ```/read``` to view others' messages. You can use Discord's own reply feature
    by right clicking the message then using ```Reply``` in order to send back a response!
    
- How do I view responses people sent back to my messages?
    - Use the command ```/responses``` to see your responses on letters!
    
- What is ```DISCORD_TOKEN``` used for?
    - It specifically links ```bot.py``` with the Discord bot so it knows what commands to use.
    
- What is ```DELETE_THRESHOLD``` used for?
    - It limits how many responses a message can get before the message is removed from the pile of
    other messages! Note that a message won't be deleted until ```/responses``` is used by the 
    person who wrote the original message!
    
- What is ```DB_URI``` used for?
    - Without a ```DB_URI```, messages are deleted the moment the bot stops running. So it is 
    required if you want the messages to be stored even when the bot is shut down.
    - An example of what one should look like: ```sqlite:////tmp/test.db```
